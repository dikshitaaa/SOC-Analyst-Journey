##  Alert vs Incident

Understanding the difference between an alert and an incident
is a core responsibility of a SOC Analyst (L1).

##  What is an Alert?

 An alert is a notification generated by security tools
like SIEM when a suspicious activity is detected.

###  Key Points:
- Automatically generated
- May be a false positive
- Requires analysis and triage

 Example:
Multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.

---

##  What is an Incident?

 An incident is a confirmed security event that impacts
the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems.

###  Key Points:
- Verified and real threat
- Requires immediate response
- Follows incident response process

 Example:
Confirmed brute force attack resulting in account compromise.

##  SOC Golden Rule

> Every incident starts as an alert,  
> but not every alert becomes an incident.

##  SOC Analyst (L1) Responsibility
- Analyze alerts
- Identify false positives
- Confirm incidents
- Escalate when required
